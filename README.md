# SecureHacks - Script

SecureHacks is a project to collect PowerShell and Python scripts for discovery of vulnerabilities in Azure & Azure AD. 
This can be useful to discovery vulnerabilities in IAM configurations etc.

Maybe this project will be extended with files, policies, kusto queries etc. for detecting and remidiating the discoveries.

**_WARNING! The code is for Proof of Concept only and should not be used in production without explict approval of the owner._**

#### Prerequisites

- Access to an Azure (AD) environment
